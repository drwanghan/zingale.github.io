<p><div class="abstract">We are investigating convection in the
   helium layer on the surface of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf
   to understand the conditions under which the helium ignities.  This
   may set the stage for a Type Ia supernova, if a shock can be driven
   into the center of the underlying white dwarf.

<p><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Our <a href="../Maestro/">Maestro</a> studies have appeared 
in two papers:

<dl>
<dt class="paper">Low Mach Number Models of Convection in Helium Shells on Sub-Chandrasehkar White Dwarfs. I. Methodology <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...764...97Z">[ads]</a></dt>
<dd class="paper">Zingale, M., Nonaka, A., Almgren, A. S., Bell, J. B., Malone, C. M., &amp;  Orvedahl, R. J. 2013, ApJ, 764, 96</dd>

<dt class="paper">Low Mach Number Modeling of Convection in Helium Shells on
Sub-Chandrasekhar White Dwarfs II: Bulk Properties of
SimpleModels <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06696">[astro-ph]</a></dt>
<dd class="paper">Jacobs, A. M., Zingale, M., Nonaka, A., Almgren, A. S.,
 &amp; Bell, J. B. 2015, submitted to ApJ</dd>

<p>The first paper demonstrated the ability of Maestro to model the
convection leading up to ignition.  Below we seen an animation of the
radial velocity in the helium layer.  Notice the development of a
granulation-like pattern.

<p>Our follow-on study explored a wide range of different initial conditions,
varying both the white dwarf mass and the mass of the helium layer.
