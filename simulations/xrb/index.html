   X-ray bursts with the low Mach number hydrodynamics code Maestro.
   Our goal is to understand how a multi-dimensional treatment of the
   convection alters the nucleosynthesis.

<p>We are modeling mixed H/He X-ray bursts with our low Mach number
hydrodynamics
code <a href="http://amrex-astro.github.io/MAESTRO/">Maestro</a>.
The nucleosynthesis is described by a 10-nuclei network that approximates
hot-CNO, 3-alpha, and rp-process breakout.  These simulations are
done in a plane-parallel geometry, with a 6 cm resolution.  These calculations follow on
from our initial pure He simulations.  Our two-dimensional results are described in
the following papers:

<p>Most recently, we've begun working on three-dimensional simulations:
