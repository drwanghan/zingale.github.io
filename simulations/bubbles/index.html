<P>&nbsp;

<p>As a flame bubble buoyantly rises, turbulence and drag compete with
the laminar flame speed in determining the shape of the bubble.  If
the rise velocity is greater than the flame speed, then the bubble
will begin to deform, gradually transforming into a toroidal shape
(whether or not a hole develops in the center depends on the burning
rate).

<P>In the above simulation (density = 2.35 x 10<sup>7</sup> g/cc), the
bubble rise velocity quickly exceeds the laminar flame speed, and as a
result, the bubble begins deforming quickly.

<p>At a higher density (4 x 10<sup>7</sup> g/cc) shown below, the
laminar flame speed is much higher and the bubble can reach a much
larger radius (measured in terms of laminar flame thicknesses) before
deformation sets in.

<p>Ultimately, it is interesting to understand how the bubble fragments.  This 
requires simulations to be done in 3-D.  Some work has been done on this
already (see the figure on the right), but more is needed in the future.
