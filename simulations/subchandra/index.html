<p><div class="abstract">We are investigating convection in the
   helium layer on the surface of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf
   to understand the conditions under which the helium ignities.  This
   may set the stage for a Type Ia supernova, if a shock can be driven
   into the center of the underlying white dwarf.

<p><h2>Initial study</h2>

<p>Our initial study explored the feasibility of the low Mach number
methodology to modeling this convection.  This is the first
<a href="../Maestro/">Maestro</a> application to model convection on the surface of a sphere.
We presented our results here:

<p>Below we seen an animation of the radial velocity in the helium layer.
Notice the development of a granulation-like pattern.
