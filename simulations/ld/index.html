<P>Results for a 4.e7 g/cc C/O Landau-Darrius unstable
flame.  

<p>Planar flames are intrinsically unstable in open domains due to the
thermal expansion across the burning front---the Landau-Darrieus
instability.  This instability leads to wrinkling and growth of the
flame surface, and corresponding acceleration of the flame, until it
is stabilized by cusp formation.  We look at the Landau-Darrieus
instability for C/O thermonuclear flames at conditions relevant to the
late stages of a Type Ia supernova explosion.  Two-dimensional direct
numerical simulations of both single-mode and multi-mode perturbations
using a low Mach number hydrodynamics code are presented.  We show the
effect of the instability on the flame speed as a function of both the
density and domain size, demonstrate the existence of the small scale
cutoff to the growth of the instability, and look for the proposed
breakdown of the non-linear stabilization at low densities.  The
effects of curvature on the flame as quantified through measurements
of the growth rate and computation of the corresponding Markstein
number.  While accelerations of a few percent are observed, they are
too small to have any direct outcome on the supernova explosion.
 

<P>MPEG-4 movie of a flame cusping.  The y-velocity is shown.  Inflow
boundary conditions inject fuel into the bottom of the domain at the
laminar flame speed, so the unperturbed flame should remain
stationary.  The domain is 384 cm on edge.

<p>Flame speed as a function of time for four different domain widths:
2.56 cm (dot-dash), 5.12 cm (solid), 10.24 cm (dash), and 20.48 cm
(dot).  The 5.12 cm domain is 83 flame thicknesses wide (dT/max{grad
T}), right on the predicted small scale cutoff for L-D growth for
these astrophysical flames (Dursi et al. 2003).  The smallest domain
wide run does not grow at all.
